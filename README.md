# Employee-Manager
This application was designed to keep track of the employees, as well as update roles & view departments.

As a manager, I have the ability to view department, employees, roles in the database.

When I click view department, all departments in database should be displayed. 

When I click update role, an employee’s name should appear in the database for me to update.

When I click add employee then I’m prompted with the option. First name, last name, role, pay & boss.

When I click view employees, the new employee should show up in the database.
